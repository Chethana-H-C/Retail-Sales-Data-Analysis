# Retail-Sales-Data-Analysis
From data to decisions: Retail sales analysis using SQL to reveal patterns, performance, and key metrics.

**📘 Project Overview**

This project demonstrates an end-to-end SQL data analysis of a retail sales dataset. It includes table creation, data cleaning, data exploration, and analytical queries to extract valuable business insights such as top customers, sales trends, and category-wise performance.

The goal of this project is to:

•Understand customer purchasing behavior

•Identify sales trends by category, time, and demographics

•Apply SQL for data cleaning, aggregation, and analytical reporting

**🗂️ 1. Table Creation**

Created a table named retail_sales to store retail transaction details such as sales date, customer demographics, item category, and sales values.

```sql
CREATE TABLE retail_sales (
    transactions_id INT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
    sale_date DATE NULL,
    sale_time TIME NULL,
    customer_id INT NULL,	
    gender VARCHAR(15) NULL,
    age INT NULL,
    category VARCHAR(15) NULL,
    quantity FLOAT NULL,	
    price_per_unit FLOAT NULL,
    cogs FLOAT NULL,
    total_sale FLOAT NULL
);
```

**♻️ 2. Data Cleaning**

• Checked for missing values in all key columns.

• Removed null and incomplete transaction records.

• Verified correct data types for all fields (DATE, TIME, FLOAT, etc.).

• Ensured all transactions_id values were unique (Primary Key).

• Checked and removed rows with missing (NULL) values to maintain data quality and accuracy.

```sql
-- Check for missing values

SELECT * 
FROM retail_sales
WHERE
    transactions_id IS NULL
    OR sale_date IS NULL
    OR sale_time IS NULL
    OR customer_id IS NULL
    OR gender IS NULL
    OR age IS NULL
    OR category IS NULL
    OR quantity IS NULL
    OR price_per_unit IS NULL
    OR cogs IS NULL
    OR total_sale IS NULL;

-- Delete rows with missing values

DELETE FROM retail_sales
WHERE
    transactions_id IS NULL
    OR sale_date IS NULL
    OR sale_time IS NULL
    OR customer_id IS NULL
    OR gender IS NULL
    OR age IS NULL
    OR category IS NULL
    OR quantity IS NULL
    OR price_per_unit IS NULL
    OR cogs IS NULL
    OR total_sale IS NULL;
```

**🔍 3. Data Exploration**

To gain an initial understanding of the dataset, several exploratory SQL queries were performed. These queries helped to understand dataset size, customer base, and product diversity.

Key Exploration Queries:

```sql

-- Total number of sales transactions

SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_sales
FROM retail_sales;

-- Total number of unique customers

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS unique_customers
FROM retail_sales;

-- Total number of product categories available

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT category) AS total_categories
FROM retail_sales;

-- Retrieve a list of all distinct product categories

SELECT DISTINCT category AS category_list
FROM retail_sales;

```
**📈 4. Data Analysis & Insights**
   
Below are some key business questions answered using SQL queries on the retail_sales dataset. These queries help in better understaning of how sales are performing, what customers prefer, and which products are doing well.

```sql
-- Q1. What sales happened on 2022-11-05?

SELECT * 
FROM retail_sales 
WHERE sale_date = '2022-11-05';

-- Q2. Which clothing orders in Nov 2022 had more than 4 items?

SELECT * 
FROM retail_sales
WHERE category = 'Clothing'
  AND quantity > 4
  AND sale_date BETWEEN '2022-11-01' AND '2022-11-30';

-- Q3. How much revenue did each category generate?

SELECT category, SUM(total_sale) AS total_sales_per_category
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category;

-- Q4. What is the average age of customers buying Beauty products?

SELECT ROUND(AVG(age), 2) AS avg_age
FROM retail_sales
WHERE category = 'Beauty';

-- Q5. Which transactions had a bill amount above ₹1000?

SELECT * 
FROM retail_sales 
WHERE total_sale > 1000;

-- Q6. How many transactions occurred by gender for each category?

SELECT category, gender, COUNT(transactions_id) AS total_transactions
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category, gender
ORDER BY category;

-- Q7. Which month performed the best each year?

SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT sale_year, sale_month, avg_sales,
           RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY sale_year ORDER BY avg_sales DESC) AS month_rank
    FROM (
        SELECT YEAR(sale_date) AS sale_year,
               MONTH(sale_date) AS sale_month,
               ROUND(AVG(total_sale), 2) AS avg_sales
        FROM retail_sales
        GROUP BY YEAR(sale_date), MONTH(sale_date)
    ) AS monthly_avg
) AS ranked_months
WHERE month_rank = 1
ORDER BY sale_year;

-- Q8. Who are the top 5 customers based on total spending?

SELECT customer_id, SUM(total_sale) AS total_sales
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY total_sales DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- Q9. How many unique customers did each category attract?

SELECT category, COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS unique_customers
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category;

-- Q10. What time of the day gets the most orders? (Shift Analysis)

SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN HOUR(sale_time) < 12 THEN 'Morning'
        WHEN HOUR(sale_time) BETWEEN 12 AND 17 THEN 'Afternoon'
        ELSE 'Evening'
    END AS shift,
    COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY shift;

```
